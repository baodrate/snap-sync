# a location on an external drive. After the initial transfer, it does
# incremental snapshots on later calls. It's important not to delete the
# snapshot created on your system since that will be used to determine the
# difference for the next incremental snapshot.

# Can set the backup directory here, or in the snapper configuration file with
# EXT_BACKUP_LOCATION
